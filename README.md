# FEATHER
feather is a scripting language for WingOS (my kernel) 
it is a c++ language with minimal dependencies in mind for the moment the only dependencies are : 

 - stdint.h header (uint64_t 32_t ...)
 - printf (with %x %i and %s support)
 - memcpy
 - isalpha
 - malloc
 - free
 - strlen




note: 

thank @N-LG @Freeloo and @meaxycomputer for the programming language name !
